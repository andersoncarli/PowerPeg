# PowerPeg Manifesto

PowerPeg is more than just a parser library; it's a revolutionary tool that brings together the best of two worlds: Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) and regular expressions. With PowerPeg, you can parse complex data formats with ease and efficiency, thanks to its unique hybrid parsing approach.

## Our Mission

At PowerPeg, our mission is to empower developers with a versatile and efficient parsing solution that simplifies the process of working with structured data.

By combining the flexibility of PEG with the speed of regular expressions, we aim to provide a tool that meets the diverse needs of modern software development.

## Core Principles

1. **Flexibility:** PowerPeg offers unmatched flexibility in defining grammars, allowing developers to express complex parsing rules with ease.

2. **Efficiency:** By leveraging the power of regular expressions, PowerPeg delivers exceptional parsing performance, even when dealing with large datasets.

3. **Ease of Use:** We believe that parsing should be straightforward and intuitive. With PowerPeg's simple API and comprehensive documentation, developers can quickly get up and running with parsing tasks.

4. **Community-Driven:** PowerPeg is an open-source project, and we value contributions from the community. We welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from developers of all skill levels.
